# TailsGame
tailsgame is a stupid floppy disk console


PLEASE EDIT CONFIG.JSON


## Requirements


`pygame`

`requests`


## How do I make a game??


You need a floppy disk (or some storage media) and you need to make a python script on the root of the drive called game.py and a function called `start(path)` with the game stuff (i would use pygame, but you can use whatever.) also, you can use the `path` var to get the local disk path. Or you can use the server repo (tailsgameserver https://github.com/tails1154/tailsgameserver)


## What systems does it work on?


Linux. (I used arch linux to create this) If you want to try to add support for windows, you can open a PR!
